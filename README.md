# youtube_analysis

Here in this project I am trying to analyse a list of video Id's, by using their metadata like, likes, dislikes, favourite, comments.
Further I want to analyse their comment sentiments about the video by using their comments.

crape data from YouTube linked to video IDs and manipulate the extracted information to dwell below 
information: 

1. Data collection process
2. Data cleaning procedures
3. Display the best ten videos based on total views using a bar graph.
4. Display the ten least popular movies based on total views using a bar graph.
5. The video's description with the most likes
6. The name of the movie with the lowest number of likes
7. The video's name with the longest length
8. Display the top ten videos with the greatest positive sentiment scores, as determined by the 
comments, using a bar graph
